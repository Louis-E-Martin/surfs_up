In this anaylsis we used sqlalchemy tools to look through a data base for weather data then added it to a dataframe and did some statistical analysis on it.

## Results
- The first major thing we see is that the temp changes little from june to december it is above 70 degreees there in bith summer and winter
- we can see the weather in the winbter varies a little more in the winter with some rare days getting below the 60s even
-Heat should never be to much of a problem if the avrage temptures for day never get above 85 degrees in the summer

## Summary
The first new data set i would loook up would be daytime highs and night time lows instead of the avrage temp of the whole day. these values could give you a better idea of how pleasent the weather is during the day and night. A second weather metric i would want to look at is the weatehr its self, was it cloudy, humid, windy or rainy all of these things could help give us a better picture of the weather in the area.
